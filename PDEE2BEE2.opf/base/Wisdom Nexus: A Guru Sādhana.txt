Wisdom Nexus: A Guru Sādhana
by Lachung Apho

ah
Āḥ
ngowo kadak chö kyi ku
The essence, primordially pure, is the dharmakāya;
rangshyin lhündrub longchö dzok
The nature, spontaneously present, is the saṃbhogakāya;
tukjé rangshar trulpé ku
And responsiveness, naturally arising, is the nirmāṇakāya—
ku sum yé dzok rangrig di
This, my own awareness in which the three kāyas are already perfect,
rangjung dön gyi pema jung
Is the self-arisen, ultimate Padmasambhava,
döné rang dang dudral mé
Who has always been one with me, beyond joining and separation.
nang drak chönyi yeshe tsal
All that I see and hear is the play of the wisdom nature.
khordé tsenma rang sar drol
The marks of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are liberated in their own place.
ösal rangjung nyukmé shi
Clear light is the naturally arisen genuine condition.
pang len jatsol dralwé bub
The enclosure beyond deliberate effort, acceptance or rejection,
ma tsal yé dzok dro dön drub
Unsought, original perfection, wherein beings' welfare is accomplished.
rangjung rigpa emaho
Self-arising pure awareness: emaho!
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ

On the tenth day of the waxing phase of the Viśākha month in the Iron Ox year, Sherab Gyatso
recorded this impression of a spontaneous composition.
